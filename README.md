# ECE387_AlarmClock


Authors: Greg Pope, Haoran Xu

This repository implements code used on an Arduino Uno board in order to simulate an alarm clock using buttons, a piezo buzzer, and a LCD display. The user can set the current time, and then set an alarm to go off at a specific time.

Here is a video demo of our alarm clock working: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pqaDSUpTBY
